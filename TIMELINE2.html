		<p class="content1">The last week we had completed till the the basic electronic circuit setup. Previously we had tested our electric circuit using a basic Blynk application. The circuit was found to be working as intended. Sir had insisted that we develop the application in MIT App Inventor .</br>The initial plan was to implement using ESP 32 but we were met with some roadblocks . ESP 32 has bluetooth but its ranges only 10m radius. Since we needed our app to function within a wider range we had to opt for wifi based over a bluetooth for connection. We also decided to switch to ESP8266 beacuse we felt it would be easier to do what we were planning with this microcontroller.</br>Below is the image of the User Interface that our teammates have made . </p>

		<p class="content2">At the same time, other team members designed a case for our product using AutoCad. After working with 2-3 designs, we finalized the design model given below because it is very aesthetic, ergonomic, and easy to handle. The safety features were also in consideration while designing.
